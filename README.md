## Personal Project: Film Photography Archive

### For film photographers who keep digital archives

I was inspired to create this application because film photography is a common hobby that me and my friends enjoy. One issue that we struggle with is the task of keeping the digital scans of our photos **organized**, **accessible**, and **separate** from other digital media. 

Additionally, this app aims to provide film-specific tools to help streamline the processes of archiving and retrieving film photos, such as:
 - tagging/filtering photos by film type
 - tagging/sorting photos by manual exposure settings (ISO, shutter speed, aperture)
 - organizing photos into "rolls" to preserve the physical organizational structure of film rolls

### User Stories

 - As a user, I want to be able to filter my photos when I access them.
 - As a user, I want to be able to add custom tags and descriptions to my photo entries.
 - As a user, I want to be able to organize my photo entries into "rolls" to represent the physical film rolls they were taken from.
